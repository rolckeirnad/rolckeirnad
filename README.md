# üëã Hey there, welcome to my Profile
My name is Daniel Gallardo, and I am currently embarking on a career in Web Development.

Coming from a background as an electrician üßë‚Äçüîß and electronics technician ü§ñ, I've always been deeply fascinated by the intersection of programming, electronics, and embedded devices. My hands-on experience with Arduino and the Metro pyboard using MicroPython has provided me with a familiarity with electronic systems, sparking my curiosity and passion for technology.

However, it's the vast and dynamic possibilities within web development that have truly captured my full attention. Transitioning into this new field, I am eager to apply my analytical skills and problem-solving abilities to web development projects. My journey from handling wires and circuits to coding and web design is a testament to my adaptability and my enthusiastic pursuit of understanding technology's ever-evolving landscape.
